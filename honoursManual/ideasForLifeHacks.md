# X Stupid Lifehacks you will Laugh About

## 1: Funny Lifehacks
If you are watching lifehack videos to feel good about the kind of stupid things people believe you are already on the right track and you will excell at hack number two!

## 2: Use your Brain!
Pretty much everything you see around you, with the exception of the sky, mountains and the sea, was made by humans. Your house, your street, dams, redirected rivers, managed forests and, of course, *YouTube* and your favourite movies, were made by people. This wasn't handed down to us by some omnibenevolent entity from the heavens, this was created by the human brain. So the next time somebody tries to tell you what to do and what fake food hacks you should believe, your brain should ring some alarm bells and assess just how benevolent this person might be, and what they get out of telling you.

## 3: Study Something.
I don't just mean university study, I mean find a hobby to be passionate about or a job to spark your imagination, and study that. The very act of studying will help you grow as a person and normally you won't just study one thing. It will give you more confidence in yourself, teach you about life, learning and failure and it may well lead to opportunities down the line, personal or professional, that you did not expect and cannot predict. That is something that is not really created by the human brain but by the interaction between human brains, something to think about if you will.

## 4: Benefit of the Doubt
After number two this one might sound counterintuitive. If you are at the beginning of this road to personal growth, and we've all been at least at the beginning, you may start by mistrusting everybody. As I said before, mistakes are part of learning (you learn that in number three), so you should expect to have been wrong about some of that mistrust, unless of course you were instead wrong about all the trust you exhibited in the first place. Most of the time people don't do stupid things because they are stupid but because they think something stupid, like believing in lizard people or being forced into an abusive religion. I find its better to understand the reasons for which people are stupid, both to help predict what kind of stupid things to expect from them and to keep myself from being just as stupid. I guess I covered that in number one, didn't I?

# Silly Little Hacks

## 1: Anti Blister Socks
Yup, just two thin pairs of socks. The double layering makes the socks rub against each other and reduces the rub on your skin. It's not magic, but it helps.
